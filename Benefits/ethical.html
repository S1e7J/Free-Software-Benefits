		<h2>Freedom</h2>
		<p>
		Let's start easy, if you want to be free on your computer you MUST use free software. Otherwise, you are at the mercy of
		the company that sells you the product. There are many examples of this, let's name 3 of them. Amazon delete George
		Orwell's 1984 book remotly and without asking users (I know it's ironic). Zoom deleted the account of some activists
		before a presentation about the Tiananmen massacre. Windows have a universal back door that let any user vulnerable and
		frequently they sell this to US government. None of this things could have happend if the software were free because
		any user could realize it and fix it. An example of this is VScode, a code editor developed by microsoft and that is
		Open Source which was reviewed by several users of the linux community realizing that it sent information to Microsft in
		response they released codium which is exactly the same code as in VScode but without the telemetry.
