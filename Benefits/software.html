            <h2> Reliabaility</h2>
            <p>
                One of the main advantages of free software is that you can trust it for security and utility aspects.
                This is due to being open source any problem you have is just a matter of reviewing the code, solving it
                and compiling.

            <h2>Adaptability</h2>
            <p>
                Because they are open source, free software is more adaptable than any other.
                You can basically program any functionality you think may be interesting or useful for your team.
                In addition, it allows adapting tools that don't have to be design for that in powerful tools

            <h2>Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
                Free software is commonly more efficient in time complexity (having highly optimized algorithms)as
                well as in resource utilization. Even if it is not optimal enough, you can try to improve it to make it
                much better.

            <h2>Communicability and Peer Review</h2>
            <p>
                One of the fundamental principles of the science is that your results must be communicanble and reviewable.
                This would be impossible if the software you use us restrictive. Because, in current science most of the analysis
                you use is done by machines that can also have errors and if you are not willing to review these programs it will hardly
                be a reliable result.
